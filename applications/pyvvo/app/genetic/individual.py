        INPUTS:

                2: Regulator tap positions will be biased (via a Gaussian

                4: Regulator state given in reg input's 'newState' - just need

                5: Regulator tap positions will be determined randomly

            capFlag: Flag for special handling of capacitors.

                1: All capacitors set to CAPSTATUS[1] (CLOSED)

                5: Capacitor positions will be determined randomly.
                
            uid: Unique ID of individual. Should be an int.
            
            regChrom: Regulator chromosome resulting from crossing two
                individuals. List of ones and zeros representing tap positions. 
                
            capChrom: Capacitor chromosome resulting from crossing two

            parents: Tuple of UIDs of parents that created this individual.
                None if individual was randomly created at population init.
                
            controlFlag: Flag to determine the control scheme used in an 
                individual's model. This will also affect how evaluation is
                performed. For example, a model with volt_var_control has to
                calculate it's tap changes and capacitor switching events after
                a model has been run, while a manual control scheme computes
                tap changing/switching before running its model.
                Possible inputs (more to come later, maybe):
                0: Manual control of regulators and capacitors
                1: Output voltage control of regulators and capacitors
                2: Output voltage control of regulators, VAR control of
                    capacitors
                3: Output voltage control of regulators, VARVOLT control of
                    capacitors
                4: volt_var_control of regulators and capacitors. This will
                    create a volt_var_control object, and set regs and caps to
                    MANUAL to avoid letting them switch at initialization
                
            NOTE: If the controlFlag is not 0, the regFlag and capFlag must
                be set to 3.
                
            recorders: dictionary of recorder objects. Top level objects 
				should be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary. Each lower
				level dictionary should have two keys: 'properties' and
				'objType.' objType can be 'recorder' or 'group_recorder'. 
				properties should be a dictionary and will be passed directly
				to modGLM.addMySQLRecorder or modGLM.addMySQLGroup_Recorder.
                
                Possible keys:
                    energy: dictionary describing recorder used to measure
                        total feeder energy
                    power: dictionary describing recorder used to measure
                        total feeder power.
                    triplexVoltage: dictionary describing group_recorder for
                        recording triplex voltages.
                        *NOTE: we'll be recording 'measured_voltage_12' which
                            at present is only valid for triplex_load
                            objects.
                            
                *NOTE: regulators and capacitors recorders will be created by
                    reading the cap and reg inputs. The interval will be taken
                    from the 'energy' table.    
                *NOTE: regulators will NOT be recorded if the controlFlag is 0,
                    as there is no need to track position/tap count.
                *NOTE: all regulators should use the same table. 
                *NOTE: capacitors will NOT be recorded if the controlFlag is 0,
                    as there is no need to track status/switch count.
                *NOTE: all capacitors should use the same table.
                
            recordMode: mode for recording mysql recorders. 'a' for append or
                'w' to purge data before writing. Append will reduce overhead,
                but you had better make sure duplicate data isn't inserted by
                accident.
